For great photos, you should check out the park by the river. The views are stunning, especially at sunset. Also, don't miss the old town square; there are some amazing buildings there.

Can’t wait to capture some amazing moments. Thanks, buddy! 😊🌅\nWolfgangSchulz: No problem! You’re going to love it here.
